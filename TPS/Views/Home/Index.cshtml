		<b>Doesn’t your business <em>deserve</em> to exist?</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>TPS</b> (Technological Problem Solvers) is your local Tech-spert (Tech-Expert).
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Be seen by people who are always looking at their screens:</b><br />
		You know it does, but without implementing current technology,
		most of your would-be customers don’t!
		<br />Very few people watch TV or listen to the radio anymore,
		let alone read the newspaper or even glance at flyers or posters.
		<br />
		We can build your websites and mobile apps.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Technology can be expensive, only buy what you NEED!</b><br />
		Not sure what hardware your staff needs? They might say they need a
		$5000 computer for their work, but may only really need a $300 station
		for basic data entry. Then again, a $100 netbook won’t help much when
		rendering 3D models and animation. It can be confusing, especially
		when you need to focus on the day-to-day operations of your business.
		<br />
		We can help you find the right tech solutions to fit your needs.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>LAN and other network configurations</b>
		Are your connections slow? Does the WiFi fail to cover the whole office?
		Need to expand? Need local backup storage? Battery backup to prevent data loss?
		<br />
		We can design and build out your local network.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Home Services:</b>
		<br />
		We also can help setup home networks, home entertainment systems, make your house "smart", almost anything!
